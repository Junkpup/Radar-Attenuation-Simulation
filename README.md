# Radar-Attenuation-Simulation
Simulating a radar-absorbent composite using Ansys HFSS. Tested for S11 and S21 coefficients for different compositions and impedance matching dielectric layers.

Meta Data has description for each test composites used and thickness of the material along with the matching layer used
